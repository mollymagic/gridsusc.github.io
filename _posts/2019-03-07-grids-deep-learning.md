“AI is the new electricity: Just as electricity
transformed almost everything 100 years ago,
today I actually have a hard time thinking of an
industry that I don’t think AI will transform in
the next several years.”

– Andrew Ng
(Founder, deeplearning.ai)

GRIDS, in collaboration with [USC AAAI](http://uscaaai.com/)conducted an informative session on the rise and impact of Deep Learning in various fields of application pertaining to real world scenarios. The session was attended by an enthusiastic crowd of aspiring AI technologists from GRIDS, AAAI, and other student organizations at USC.
This workshop was lead by [Samar Haider](https://samarh.github.io) who gave a high level overview of Neural Networks & it’s usage in fields ranging from image segmentation and image captioning to human sentiment representations and writing stories. He further went on to explain the skeleton of a neural network and the various components that make up a CNN / RNN. The talk then progressed onto an explanation on how to get started with implementing one’s own Neural Network model. The attendees were informed about various hardware/ software tools which they could use as a beginner’s stack for Deep Learning. The workshop concluded with Samar citing some popular courses, books and papers which provide ample knowledge on this topic.
