Partnering with [USC AAAI](http://uscaaai.com/), our very own [Samar Haider](https://samarh.github.io) gave a presentation on Deep Learning to an enthusiastic crowd of aspiring AI technologists from GRIDS, AAAI, and other student organizations. For all those who could not attend and for those who may wish to view the presentation again, the slides can be found [here](https://samarh.github.io/dl/).
